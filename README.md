# Compressor

In this project i did a little compressor of an image to reduce the size of an image
with a couple of line in python

###How it works?
you must run it in the console and you should type
`python compressor.py image.png`
in that example picture the file's name is `image.png`
once you run that the system will shows you 
> successfully reduce

and then the new file in the same directory called
>NEW.jpg

now you can check that both of the image are pretty similar and the `NEW.jpg` is smaller than the original
