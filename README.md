# Mini Projects
In this repo i will do some interesting quick projects in python, javascript and maybe other languages

## Every project will be in a different branch than the others, just for sort better the repo

## Why do i do this?

I think that i need to start to do projects more frecuently and this could be a way to do some of them in the middle from the other big projects
---

Some of the projects are from this youtube channel [Linkfy](https://www.youtube.com/c/Linkfydev) rights to this channel.
i just redo the projects and maybe add one or two things

---
if i find other youtube channels or blogs... i will add the autors here
